              <h2>Coding</h2>
              <p>Even before high school I was playing with Visual Basic. While I didn't get too much farther than "Hello World," I discovered that the straightforward, systematized nature of coding meshed perfectly with my personality.
                  After that came some time with HTML and Javascript, but I never took it to the career level. I would help friends out when they wanted to spruce
                  up an existing website, or even build websites with WordPress, but it was always side projects.

              </p>
              <p>Now I'm ready to make this a true career and to dive deep into a tech field. I've always wanted to do this for a living, and I'm grateful that I now have the opportunity.</p>

              <h2>Cooking</h2>
                <p>I love good food! I'm a trained chef and have worked for numerous high end restaurants. Anything from French to Thai to Japanese is fair game for me. Espscially when they can all be combined!</p>      
                <p>While I do love to cook and working in restaurants is always exciting, it's not particularly good for raising a family. It's also not a strong skill for helping people beyond just a meal or two.</p>
                <p>Learning how to talk to people and getting some hands on management experience has been invaluable and I look forward to using those skills in my new career.</p>

            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p>25 years ago, I was 11 years old working on a old Intel 386 computer running the absolute latest version of Windows 3.1, connecting to CompuServe with a 14.4 Kb/s modem, and pushing a blazing 4 KB of Ram.</p>
            <p>12 years ago, I was saving up for a strange new phone that Apple was going to release. Supposedly, you could access the actual internet, play music, AND talk all on the same device!</p>
            <p>Currently, one of the goals I have with learning to code for a career is being able to explore quantum computing. For my entire life, I've wanted to be at the forefront of technology and now I can be!</p>
