              <h2>Where I've been</h2>
              <p>Traveling is something that I've been doing literally since before I was born. My parents took a two week vacation to the Mediterranean before they even knew I was there! Since then, I've been to Canada, Mexico, Vietnam, and about half the states in the US.</p>

              <h2>Where I'd Like to Go</h2>
                <p>I would really love to spend a week or three in Europe, starting with Ireland. You can't go wrong with Castles and Guiness! I'd also love to see Russia at some point, but I feel like that's going to have to wait until I can be sure I'll come back!</p>

            <h2>Travel and Food</h2>
            <p>My love for food is directly linked to my love for travel. In fact, I'd say they're really the same thing. Can you really say you've been to a place if you didn't try any of the local food there?</p>
